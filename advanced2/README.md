# Beep-Sat Advanced-2

Need at least CP7.2, use libs and tasks from this directory to ensure functionality

Advanced-2 introduces:
1. deep sleep functionality via `alarm` module. Enables things like wake-from-radio (aka "hot start") and improved low battery behavior
2. default cubesat "config" concept with on-chip or SD card loading
